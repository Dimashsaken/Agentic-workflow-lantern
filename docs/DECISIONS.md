# Architecture Decisions

Read before changing the design. Append-dated; never rewrite old entries — supersede them.

## D1 — 2026-08-24 — Agent knowledge is harness-agnostic files

Each role is `charter.md` + `skills.md` + `memory.md` under `agents/<role>/`. Claude
Code subagents (`.claude/agents/`) are thin wrappers that load these; the Azure runner
loads the same files into its system prompt. **Why:** the fleet spans two model
providers and three execution surfaces (laptop, EC2 interactive, EC2 headless);
duplicating role knowledge per harness would drift immediately. **Consequence:**
wrappers must stay thin — role content added to a wrapper instead of the role folder
is a bug.

## D2 — 2026-08-24 — Provider matrix: Foundry for Claude Code, Azure OpenAI for the runner

Verified against official docs (claude-code third-party integrations, 2026-08):

| Need | Provider | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| Claude Code sessions/subagents | Claude via **Microsoft Foundry** (`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY=1`) | Claude Code runs Claude models only (Anthropic API / Bedrock / Vertex / Foundry). Foundry bills CCUs on the Azure invoice and decrements MACC → uses the org's Azure credits. |
| GPT-driven stages (browser QA execution etc.) | **Azure OpenAI** deployments via `tools/azure-runner` | Uses the same Azure credits; an Azure OpenAI key cannot power Claude Code. |

Model pinning on Foundry is mandatory for fleet machines (alias defaults can lag the
resource's enabled models). Config: `infra/ec2/README.md`.

## D3 — 2026-08-24 — QA video = Playwright `recordVideo`, not screen capture

Videos come from Playwright's context-level `recordVideo` (+ tracing), which works
headless on EC2 with no display, GPU, or ffmpeg. **Why:** zero-infra, per-scenario
files, works identically under every harness because recording is a property of the
browser context, not the model driving it. Full-desktop xvfb+ffmpeg capture is the
documented exception, not the default. **Consequence:** videos are per-context — the
"one context per scenario" convention in `tools/qa-recorder` is load-bearing for
reviewable, short videos.

## D4 — 2026-08-24 — The run folder is the only handoff channel

Stages communicate exclusively through `workflow/runs/<run-id>/` reports. No chat
handoffs, no side channels. **Why:** durable, auditable, resumable by any harness, and
it forces each stage to write for a reader — which is also what makes the pipeline
debuggable when a stage goes wrong. Large binaries (videos) live in S3 and are linked,
keeping git fast.

## D5 — 2026-08-24 — Brain/harness split: Claude Code (Foundry) is the default harness; GPT runs in its own harness

An agent = brain (LLM) + harness (tool loop). Claude Code is a harness that accepts
only Claude brains; "GPT brain inside Claude Code" does not exist. Therefore:
**default all pipeline stages to Claude brain + Claude Code harness via Foundry**
(zero harness code, native subagents/MCP/CLAUDE.md, same Azure credit pool), and run
GPT deployments (`sol`/`terra`) through the OpenAI Agents SDK in `tools/azure-runner`
only where a high-volume second brain earns its keep (bulk QA execution, batch
checks). Both harnesses consume the same MCP tool layer (`.mcp.json`), so tools are
written once. **Consequence:** build order is Foundry fleet first; azure-runner is
deferred until a GPT-driven stage is actually scheduled. Full explanation:
`docs/AGENT-TOOLING.md` §1.

## D6 — 2026-08-24 — Agents act on GitHub as `lantern-bot`, never as humans

One machine identity (machine user now, GitHub App if audit needs grow) with Write on
product repos; fine-grained PAT in SSM. Branch protection enforces the contract:
`main`/`staging` are PR-only with human review; agents push only `feat/*`, `fix/*`,
`proto/*`. Commits carry the run-ID prefix plus a `Lantern-Agent: <role>` trailer;
agent PRs are labeled `agent:<role>`. **Why:** clean audit trail (git shows which
agent did what), instant revocability, and no agent ever inherits a human's broader
permissions. Details: `docs/AGENT-TOOLING.md` §3.
